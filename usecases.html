<h3>1. Text analytics</i></h3>
	We have shown examples of <i>DycomDetector</i> on different text data: <i>Wikinews</i> (Figure 2), <i>Huffington Post</i> (Figure 5), <i>Crooks and Liars</i> (Figure 1), and <i>Esquire</i> (Figure 3) in our submitted manuscripts. The following figure shows another use case on the <i>EmptyWheel</i> blogs. In particular, terms (nodes) are scaled by their popularity and color-coded by category, links are filtered by co-occurrence frequency (or edge weight &ge; 3). We lensed on April-October 2013. The modularity <i>Q</i> for each refined network snapshot is plotted in the pink bar of the histogram underneath. For example in May 2013, the pink bar (at the arrow) is tallest compared to other bars since the current filter (edge weight &ge; 3) clearly reveals two big communities in <b>Box B1</b> and <b>Box C1</b>.     
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Box A1</b> and <b>Box A2</b> highlight the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombing">Boston Marathon bombing</a> occurred on April 15, 2013. Two homemade bombs detonated near the finish line of the annual <span style="color:#d52829">Boston Marathon</span>, killing three people and injuring several hundred others. FBI later identified the bombers: <span style="color:#2077b5"> Tsarnaev</span> brothers.  </li>

	   <li><b>Box B1</b> and <b>Box B2</b> relate to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibragim_Todashev">the triple homicide</a> that took place in <span style="color:#d52829">Waltham</span>, Massachusetts</a>. <span style="color:#2077b5">Todashev</span> is a friend of <span style="color:#2077b5">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</span>, the <span style="color:#d52829">Boston Marathon</span> bomber. The investigators said that <span style="color:#2077b5">Todashev</span> had implicated both himself and <span style="color:#2077b5">Tamerlan Tsarnaev</span> in the <span style="color:#d52829">Waltham</span> murders before he was killed on May 22, 2013.
	   </li>

	   <li><b>Box C1</b> and <b>Box C2</b> refer to the <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2013/05/14/if-undiebomb-2-0-is-one-of-the-worst-leaks-of-holders-career-why-is-john-brennan-cia-director/"><i>EmptyWheel</i> blogs</a>: If <span style="color:#d52829">UndieBomb</span> 2.0 is one of the worst leaks of holder's career, why is <span style="color:#2077b5">John Brennan</span> CIA director?

	</ul>

<h3>2. Other applications</h3>
Although originally motivated to analyze text documents, we soon realized that <i>DycomDetector</i> has more general implications to other domains as well. We are going to demonstrate <i>DycomDetector</i> on the two movie co-star networks (<i>IMDB</i> and <i>PopCha</i>), the co-authorship networks in IEEE VIS publications, and the protein interactions extracted from biomedical literature (the Fries Cards database).
<h4>2.1. IMDB co-star network</h4>
	On the bottom left panel, we provide the list of top actors based on their appearance frequency in 9,964 movies rated 8 stars or higher from 1975 to 2015. This collection has 66,182 actors that are color-coded based on the genre of his/her first movie: <span style="color:#2077b5">comedy</span>, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">drama</span>, and <span style="color:#2c9f2e">action</span>. Two actors relate as they act in the same movie(s). When users select an actor from the list (for example, <span style="color:#2077b5">Schmidt, Michael Q.</span>), the network on the right summarizes his acting career. In particular, detected communities on the top are associated with highly rated movies. Larger clusters are movies with more actors/actresses.

In the second example of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">the IMDB data</a>, we selected <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Rosen, Larry (III)</span> (at the origin of the left arrow). As shown in the time series, he has many good movies in 2012. Four out of these movies, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Rosen, Larry (III)</span> co-stars with <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Churchson, Scott</span> (at the second arrow) in <span style="color:#2077b5">Lola</span>, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Nowhere to Hide</span>, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Last Night</span>, and <span style="color:#ff7f0f">The Edge</span>. This fact is highlighted by the thickest arc connecting the two actors in 2012. Also notice that the duo filmed <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Wrong Place, Wrong Time</span> (2013) and <span style="color:#2c9f2e">No One to Protect You</span> (2014). Movie details are displayed on mouse over links/arcs.

<h4>2.2. PopCha movie network</h4>
The <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">PopCha database</a> has 172 movies and 1,201 actors. As depicted in the network snapshots, some actors involve multiple movies in the same year. When inspecting the time series and arc diagrams, we found that some actors have the same co-actors over years, possibly in the same TV shows.

<h4>2.3. IEEE Visualization publications</h4>
	<a href="http://www.vispubdata.org/site/vispubdata/home">The IEEE VIS dataset</a> has 2,867 visualization papers accepted in 1990-2016. In the following figure, we selected “<span style="color:#2c9f2e">Chris North</span>” from the top author's list (at the origin of the green arrow). Nodes are <span style="color:#2c9f2e">North</span>'s co-authors on his IEEE VIS publications which are ranked and scaled based on their publication frequency. Two authors are connected as they publish together to IEEE VIS venues: <span style="color:#2077b5">Vis</span>, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">VAST</span>, <span style="color:#2c9f2e">InfoVis</span>, and <span style="color:#d52829">SciVis</span>. Detected communities on the top associate with <span style="color:#2c9f2e">North</span>'s VIS papers. The networks are empty in 2007 and 2008 since he did not have IEEE VIS publications in these two years. After that, <span style="color:#2c9f2e">North</span>'s collaboration is expanded significantly. Visualizing the time series, we can easily spot researchers who have strong collaborations with <span style="color:#2c9f2e">Chris North</span>. For example, his <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~north/North-CV.pdf">PhD students</a>, <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Alex Endert</span> (<a href="http://va.gatech.edu/endert/bio/">graduated in 2012</a>) and <span style="color:#ff7f0f">Christopher Andrews</span> (<a href="http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~candrews/resources/Andrews_CV.pdf">graduated in 2011</a>) at the orange arrows, continuously published at VIS conferences from 2009 to 2013.

In another example, we have filtered “<span style="color:#2077b5">Daniel Keim</span>” publications. Larger nodes are authors with more publications in a given year. Authors are color-coded by their first publication venue. The word clouds show top co-authors of <span style="color:#2077b5">Keim</span> over years. The arc diagrams at the bottom summarize <span style="color:#2077b5">Keim</span>'s collaboration network in the past 15 years. At the second blue arrow, <span style="color:#2077b5">Tobias Schreck</span> has a long collaboration history with <span style="color:#2077b5">Daniel Keim</span> since he was a PhD student (<a href="https://www.tugraz.at/institute/cgv/Schreck/">2002-2006</a>).

<h4>2.4. Protein networks extracted from scientific literature</h4>
<a href="https://github.com/clulab/reach/wiki/Datasets">The Fries Cards</a> is generated by <a href="https://github.com/clulab/reach">REACH group</a> at the University of Arizona. The following example shows a subset of 5,267 cards extracted from PMC papers from 1996-2015 focusing on two types of protein interactions: <span style="color:#2077b5">increase activity</span> and <span style="color:#ff7f0f">decrease activity</span>. The detected communities in network snapshots highlight proteins/proteins families and their interactions discovered over time. We can focus on the discovery around an interested protein by using the search box or mousing over its name in the time series. Conflicting evidences (for example, one paper says <i>protein A</i> <span style="color:#2077b5">increases activity</span> of <i>protein B</i> while another paper says <i>protein A</i> <span style="color:#ff7f0f">decreases activity</span> of <i>protein B</i>) can be detected using <i>DycomDetector</i>.
